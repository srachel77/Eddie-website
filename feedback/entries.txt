Byron	Austin Tx	breeves556&#64;gmail&#46;com		I just left the DPS office with my Class A CDL! I had never driven a tractor trailer before in my life and in 1 week, I have my license. I was really pretty nervous but Eddie put my mind at ease. The training staff are great and very patient. Eddie even had study guides to help prepare me for the written tests, and because of those I was able to take and pass all my written tests the same day. I even scored 100% on the air brake test thanks to Eddie.I did my research and looked around for training schools and Austin CDL Services was the top, hands down! Not only was it less than one third the cost of other schools, you can get your lisense in a week, not 6-8 weeks.Austin CDL Services is the FASTEST and LEAST EXPENSIVE way to get your Class A  PERIOD!<br />Thanks again to Eddie Torres!<br />Sincerely Byron,<br />Austin TX.
